    <h1>Boilerplate Node, TypeScript, Sass</h1>
    <p class="myClass">MyClass</p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this StackBlitz project is to provide a starting point for
      a simple project using HTML, Sass and TypeScript. The standard one
      provided by StackBlitz doesn't include sass.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the working files are under the 'docs' folder. This is so that it can
      be easily saved to Github and served by Github pages as a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any .scss files in the docs folder will be watched by sass and compiled
      into styles/styles.css.
    </p>
    <p>
      And .ts files in the docs folder will be watched by TypeScript and
      compiled into the javascript folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In development, Vite will serve the web page and watch for any changes to
      the input files.
    </p>
    <p>
      This boilerplate isn't meant for anything particularly spectacular - I
      just use it as a base (via forking it) when I just want to try out
      something quick and simple.
