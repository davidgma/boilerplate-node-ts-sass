# boilerplate-node-ts-sass

The purpose of this StackBlitz project is to provide a starting point for a simple project using HTML, Sass and TypeScript. The standard one provided by StackBlitz doesn't include sass.

All the working files are under the 'docs' folder. This is so that it can be easily saved to Github and served by Github pages as a website.

Any .scss files in the docs folder will be watched by sass and compiled into styles/styles.css.

And .ts files in the docs folder will be watched by TypeScript and compiled into the javascript folder.

In development, Vite will serve the web page and watch for any changes to the input files.

This boilerplate isn't meant for anything particularly spectacular - I just use it as a base (via forking it) when I just want to try out something quick and simple.
